Staking on Base primarily revolves around liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) for ETH, where you deposit ETH to receive a tokenized version (e.g., cbETH) that accrues staking rewards while remaining usable in DeFi. For USDC, "staking" often means providing liquidity to pools or yield vaults, as it's not a native PoS asset. Base's ecosystem emphasizes composability, letting you stack yields across protocols.
