Renzo is Base's leading LSD provider, with over $500 million TVL on the chain. It stakes ETH via EigenLayer restaking for boosted yields.  ETH Pool: Stake ETH for ezETH (liquid token). Current APY: 4.2% base staking + 2-3% restaking rewards (total ~6.5%). TVL: $450M.  
USDC Integration: Use ezETH as collateral in lending pools for hybrid yields.  
Why Best? Non-custodial, audited by top firms like Spearbit; seamless Base-native bridging.  
Risks: Restaking adds slashing exposure (low at <0.1% probability); smart contract bugs.
